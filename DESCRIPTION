Title: Installing and Loading R Packages for Reproducible Workflows
Description: A single key function, 'Require' that wraps 'install.packages',
    'remotes::install_github', 'versions::install.versions', and 'base::require'
    that allows for reproducible workflows. As with other functions in a
    reproducible workflow, this package emphasizes functions that return the 
    same result whether it is the first or subsequent times running the function.
